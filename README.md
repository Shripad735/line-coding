# 🌐 Computer Networks Visualization & Simulation Project

Welcome to the **Computer Networks Visualization & Simulation** project! This repository contains interactive visualizations and simulations of key concepts in computer networks like **line-coding techniques**, **HTTP-DNS**, **TCP-UDP**, and more. 🎓

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to provide a visual understanding of crucial networking concepts through simulations, making it easier to grasp abstract ideas. Whether you're learning about networking or simply want to see these concepts in action, this tool is perfect for you! 🖥️

## 🎯 Features

- **Line Coding Techniques** (NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, RZ)
- **HTTP-DNS Simulation** 🕸️
- **TCP vs UDP** 📡
- Interactive user interface for exploring networking principles 👨‍💻
- Dynamic visual representations to aid in learning and teaching

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. **Line Coding Techniques**
   - Visualizes various line coding methods like:
     - NRZ-L (Non-Return to Zero Level)
     - NRZ-I (Non-Return to Zero Inverted)
     - Manchester Encoding
     - Differential Manchester Encoding
     - RZ (Return to Zero)
     
   Each visualization demonstrates the waveform based on input data.

### 2. **HTTP-DNS Simulation**
   - Simulates the process of **DNS resolution** and **HTTP requests**.
   - Learn how DNS converts a domain name to an IP address and how HTTP facilitates web communication. 🌐

### 3. **TCP vs UDP Simulation**
   - Compares **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**.
   - Shows packet transmission, reliability, and connection setup.
   - Ideal for understanding the differences between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. ⚡

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend 🌟
- **Bootstrap** for styling 🚀
- **Canvas API** for visualizations 🎨

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
